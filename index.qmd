## Background


### Personal Statement

Students should provide a brief (up to approximately 500 words) personal statement.  This statement should include a narrative of their career goals to provide a context for the materials provided in their portfolio.  The statement can also provide details regarding current accomplishments and expertise, anticipated accomplishments and/or expertise to be gained in the program and plans to acquire it, obstacles experienced or anticipated, or any other relevant information to contextualize their portfolio or establish themselves as an emerging clinical scientist.

Clinical Lunch and Learn Presentation 
Title: Personal sensing in clinical research
Date: April 7, 2021
Abstract: Personal sensing is a longitudinal method for in situ data collection. Raw personal sensing data streams (e.g., sensor or log data) can be used to create measures that act as indicators of mental health constructs. Thus, paving the way for more accessible and timely treatment and intervention options. However, using personal sensing in clinical settings requires that people accept their use and will sustain the behaviors they require. This presentation provides an overview of the acceptability of various personal sensing data streams individually and in the same context among participants with alcohol use disorder. Future implications of the acceptability of these measures will be discussed in the context of my First Year Project.

Title: A personal sensing approach to alcohol lapse prediction
Date: August 5, 2021
Abstract: Alcohol use disorder is a chronic relapsing disease. People can relapse days, weeks, months, or even years after achieving abstinence. Identifying when an initial lapse will occur is an important goal in preventing lapses, repeated lapses, and relapse. Because of the dynamic nature of lapse risk, traditional treatment, like monthly therapy or biweekly therapy sessions, may not be best suited for monitoring lapse risk and intervening prior to relapse, or a full return to previous drinking behavior. Personal sensing methods offer a tool for capturing fluctuations in lapse risk in real time. One understudied personal sensing method in the substance use literature is cellular communication logs. The present study contextualizes participants’ communications with self-report information about their frequently communicated with contacts and seeks to develop a predictive model to predict when someone is at a high risk of lapsing.

### Poster Presentations
- CPA Poster Abstract:
Personal sensing may improve digital therapeutics for mental health care. However, further development and use of personal sensing first requires better understanding of its acceptability to people targeted for these mental health applications. Participants (N = 154; 50% female; mean age = 41; 87% White, 97% Non-Hispanic) in early recovery from alcohol use disorder were recruited from the Madison, WI area. Participants engaged with active (EMA, audio check-in, and sleep quality) and passive (geolocation, cellular communication logs, and text message content) personal sensing methods for up to three months. We assessed the acceptability of these methods using both behavioral and self-report measures. The average completion rate for all requested EMAs was 81%. The completion rate for the audio check-in was 55%. Aggregate participant ratings indicated all methods to be significantly more acceptable (all P’s < .05) compared to neutral across subjective measures of interference, dislike, and willingness to use for one year. Participants did not significantly differ in their dislike of active compared to passive methods (P = .23). However, participants reported a higher willingness to use passive methods for one year compared to active methods (P = .04). These results suggest both active and passive personal sensing methods are generally acceptable to people with alcohol use disorder. Important individual differences were observed both across people and methods which indicate opportunities for future improvements.


### Workshops
Introduction to Structural Equation Modeling Workshop 
Instructors: Daniel Bauer, Ph.D. & Patrick Curran, Ph.D.
Date: May 10 – 12, 2021
Summary: A three-day workshop focused on the application and interpretation of statistical models that are designed for the analysis of multivariate data with latent variables. Although the traditional multiple regression model is a powerful analytical tool within the social sciences, this is also highly restrictive in a variety of ways. Not only are all variables assumed to have no measurement error, but it is also limited to a single dependent variable with unidirectional effects. The structural equation model (SEM) generalizes the linear regression model to include multiple dependent variables, reciprocal effects, indirect effects, and the estimation and removal of measurement error through the inclusion of latent variables. The SEM is a general framework that allows for the empirical testing of research hypotheses in ways not otherwise possible. In this workshop we provide an introduction to SEM that includes path analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation models with latent variables, and which focuses on both establishing a conceptual understanding of the model and how it is applied in practice.

## Diversity Experiences

### Diversity Statement

### Workshops

Empowering people to break the bias habit: Evidenced-based approaches to reducing bias and creating inclusion
Speaker: Will Cox, Ph.D.
Description: 3-hour workshop to introduce academic audiences to the concepts of implicit or unconscious biases and assumptions about diverse groups of people by treating the application of such biases as a “habit.” Participants will uncover their own biases, discover the underlying concepts and language used in the psychological and social psychological literature to describe such processes, participate in interactive discussions about the potential influence of implicit or unconscious bias in their department/unit, and learn evidence-based strategies for reducing the application of these biases.
